# Paper-VTGraph
Construction and proof of vertex transitive graph family

## Abstract

In networks modeling interactions between agents (e.g. people, computers),
the agents often have a limited capacity to form interactions.
If the vertex degrees grow with the size of the network,
the number of interactions will exceed the capacity of the agents,
limiting the scale of the network.
Sparse networks, such as regular trees, are not subject to this limitation on scaling.
However, trees impose a hierarchical relationship between agents.
In some applications, an egalitarian relationship between agents is desirable,
formally described as vertex transitivity.
In this paper we construct an infinite family G_n
of sparse (|E| = O(|V|log(log |V|)),
small-diameter (d = O(log |V|)), vertex-transitive graphs.
